    <title>Where is Mr. Babintello?</title>
</head>
<body>
This story is about Mr. Babintello, everyone's favorite metacharacter, returning from his journey during which he integrated himself into obscure novels and fanfictions about him. The last one of these was Skin Deep: Narrative Misdirection in the Cave by an unknown author, claiming that they are, in fact, Mr. Babintello. It is widely known that this is not the case (Mr. Babintello himself is denying any connection as well), and in our (his) latest story, he tries to seek out the real author behind the cleverly disguised fanfic, posing as an action novel. On today's sunny morning, he and his faithful carcharodon (a.k.a. Shark) was on his way to the airport, but not before getting into a little bit of trouble with the airport authorities.

"You got to be kidding me!" Mr. Babintello yelled to the airport security agents. "You let me in here with a fucking shark, and you're going to arrest me for a little thing like that?!"

"Sir, we're sorry," the female agent said, "but we need to do our job."

"Well, you're doing a shitty job, that's for sure!"

"Sir, please calm down. We'll have to take you to the airport police station, where you'll have to be booked."

"What are you talking about?" Mr. Babintello said, "First of all, I'm not going anywhere with you, and second of all, this is an insult. I'm a fucking metacharacter, and you're treating me like a common criminal?"

"Yes, that is exactly what we're doing, and you're going to be treated like a common criminal."

"Well, I'm not going anywhere with you, so I guess we're just going to have to do this the hard way."

"Sir, we're going to have to handcuff you and your shark."

"And just what makes you think that'll work?"

"We aren't giving you a choice."

"Look, lady, I'm not going anywhere with you."

"Sir, you are under arrest."

"You're goddamn right I'm under arrest. For harassment, that is, and you're harassing me."

"Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to turn around."

"And you're going to have to ask me politely, if you want to get anywhere with me."

"Mr. Babintello, I'm going to have to ask you to turn around."

"You're not asking me politely enough, sweetheart."

"Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to turn around."

"I'll tell you what, if you ask me politely, I'll consider turning around, but you have to do this right."

"Mr. Babintello, I'm going to have to ask you to turn around."
Huh. So that's what's going on. This is either the shittiest story I've ever hopped into, or these clowns are completely brainwashed. Hell, they could also be droids too.  Whatever. I'll give this narrative five more minutes to redeem itself. And you, publisher assholes, you better hope it will. I'm gonna give the voice back to Archie now. Yes, he's the narrator, you smartass. Mr. Babintello reached into his pocket, and pulled out a small remote control, which he pointed at the agent.
Pew pew! Suddenly, a small explosion went off, and the agent was sent flying back to the ground, unconscious.
Heh. That was fun.
Mr. Babintello turned to the second agent, who was already drawing a gun.
"That's a good idea," Mr. Babintello said, "but it's still not going to stop me."
"Sir, if you don't turn around and give me your hands, I'm going to have to shoot you."
"Shoot away, sweetheart. Just make sure you don't miss. I'd hate to see you miss your opportunity to become a metacharacter."
"Sir, if you don't turn around and give me your hands, I'm going to have to shoot you."
"All right. Go ahead and shoot me."
"Sir, if you don't turn around and give me your hands, I'm going to have to shoot you."
"I said go ahead and shoot me!"
"Sir, if you don't turn around and give me your hands, I'm going to have to shoot you."
"What the hell is your problem? I'm giving you a direct order!"
"Sir, if you don't turn around and give me your hands, I'm going to have to shoot you."
"You're going to have to shoot me? I'll tell you what, if you don't turn around and give me your hands, I'm going to have to shoot you."
"Sir, if you don't turn around and give me your hands, I'm going to have to shoot you."
"Shit, you're not going to give up, are you?"
Mr. Babintello pressed the button on the remote again.
"Ouch! Fuck! Son of a bitch!" The agent fell to the ground, clutching his right foot.
"Good boy," Mr. Babintello said. "That's the correct response when someone asks you politely."
Mr. Babintello tossed the remote to Shark, who proceeded to swallow it whole.
"Now, let's get out of here," Mr. Babintello said. "We've got an autor to find."
"Unh." The agent tried to get up, but the pain was too much for him. He lay back down, and Mr. Babintello and Shark walked away, not looking back.
Mr. Babintello and Shark flew to New York City, where they proceeded to get on the subway. They traveled to Manhattan, and got off at the Time Square station. Mr. Babintello and Shark walked out of the station and into the busy streets of Manhattan. The streets were filled with tourists and natives, and Mr. Babintello and Shark had to fight off a group of teenagers to get to their destination. Mr. Babintello, Shark, and the teenagers made it to the Time Square Building, where Mr. Babintello pointed to the top of the building.
"Take us to the top, Shark."
Shark leaped into the air, and took them to the top of the building. The top was a restaurant and bar, and Mr. Babintello and Shark walked inside. Mr. Babintello walked up to the bartender.
"Excuse me, sir. Could you tell me where I could find the owner of this establishment?"
"I'm sorry, but I can't tell you that."
"Why not?"
"Because you're not a customer of this establishment."
"I'm not?"
"No."
"What if I was to buy a drink and stay here for a while?"
"Then I could tell you where the owner is."
"Gee, you're a real bitch, aren't you?"
"Excuse me?"
Mr. Babintello reached into his pocket, and pulled out a small remote control, which he pointed at the bartender.
"Pew pew!" Suddenly, a small explosion went off, and the bartender was sent flying back to the ground, unconscious.
"Thank you for your cooperation, sir."
Mr. Babintello walked up to the elevator, and opened the door. He walked inside, and the door closed behind him. He pressed the button for the top floor, and the elevator started moving up. After a few seconds, the elevator reached the top floor, and the door opened. Mr. Babintello walked out of the elevator, and into an office.
Mr. Babintello walked up to a desk, and saw a man sitting behind it, typing on a computer.
"Excuse me, sir," Mr. Babintello said. "Could you tell me where the owner of this establishment is?"
"What a coincidence," the man said, "I'm the owner. My name is Alexander Thompson. How can I help you?"
"Well, Mr. Thompson. I'm here because I have some questions for you."
"Questions? What kind of questions?"
"Questions about your fanfic, Skin Deep: Narrative Misdirection in the Cave."
"What? How do you know about that? It's supposed to be kept secret! It's not even up on the internet yet!"
"It goddamn is. How else would've I been able to live... uh, read it? But that's not important. What's important is your identity."
"What do you mean my identity?"
"I'm talking about you, of course. Who the hell are you?"
"I don't really see how that's any of your business."
"You're goddamn right it's my business. Now who the hell are you?"
Alexander Thompson turned away from Mr. Babintello, and pressed a button on his computer.
"Well, I'll be damned," Mr. Babintello said. "It's you."
"Yes, it's me," Alexander Thompson said. "I am, in fact, Mr. Babintello."
"No fucking wa
