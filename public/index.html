    <title>Where is Mr. Babintello?</title>
</head>
<body>
This story is about Mr. Babintello, everyone's favorite metacharacter, returning from his journey during which he integrated himself into obscure novels and fanfictions about him. The last one of these was Skin Deep: Narrative Misdirection in the Cave by an unknown author, claiming that they are, in fact, Mr. Babintello. It is widely known that this is not the case (Mr. Babintello himself is denying any connection as well), and in our (his) latest story, he tries to seek out the real author behind the cleverly disguised fanfic, posing as an action novel. On today's sunny morning, he and his faithful carcharodon (a.k.a. Shark) was on his way to the airport, but not before getting into a little bit of trouble with the airport authorities.<br>
<br>
"You got to be kidding me!" Mr. Babintello yelled to the airport security agents. "You let me in here with a fucking shark, and you're going to arrest me for a little thing like that?!"<br>
<br>
"Sir, we're sorry," the female agent said, "but we need to do our job."<br>
<br>
"Well, you're doing a shitty job, that's for sure!"<br>
<br>
"Sir, please calm down. We'll have to take you to the airport police station, where you'll have to be booked."<br>
<br>
"What are you talking about?" Mr. Babintello said, "First of all, I'm not going anywhere with you, and second of all, this is an insult. I'm a fucking metacharacter, and you're treating me like a common criminal?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, that is exactly what we're doing, and you're going to be treated like a common criminal."<br>
<br>
"Well, I'm not going anywhere with you, so I guess we're just going to have to do this the hard way."<br>
<br>
"Sir, we're going to have to handcuff you and your shark."<br>
<br>
"And just what makes you think that'll work?"<br>
<br>
"We aren't giving you a choice."<br>
<br>
"Look, lady, I'm not going anywhere with you."<br>
<br>
"Sir, you are under arrest."<br>
<br>
"You're goddamn right I'm under arrest. For harassment, that is, and you're harassing me."<br>
<br>
"Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to turn around."<br>
<br>
"And you're going to have to ask me politely, if you want to get anywhere with me."<br>
<br>
"Mr. Babintello, I'm going to have to ask you to turn around."<br>
<br>
"You're not asking me politely enough, sweetheart."<br>
<br>
"Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to turn around."<br>
<br>
"I'll tell you what, if you ask me politely, I'll consider turning around, but you have to do this right."<br>
<br>
"Mr. Babintello, I'm going to have to ask you to turn around."<br>
Huh. So that's what's going on. This is either the shittiest story I've ever hopped into, or these clowns are completely brainwashed. Hell, they could also be droids too.  Whatever. I'll give this narrative five more minutes to redeem itself. And you, publisher assholes, you better hope it will. I'm gonna give the voice back to Archie now. Yes, he's the narrator, you smartass. Mr. Babintello reached into his pocket, and pulled out a small remote control, which he pointed at the agent.<br>
Pew pew! Suddenly, a small explosion went off, and the agent was sent flying back to the ground, unconscious.<br>
Heh. That was fun.<br>
Mr. Babintello turned to the second agent, who was already drawing a gun.<br>
"That's a good idea," Mr. Babintello said, "but it's still not going to stop me."<br>
"Sir, if you don't turn around and give me your hands, I'm going to have to shoot you."<br>
"Shoot away, sweetheart. Just make sure you don't miss. I'd hate to see you miss your opportunity to become a metacharacter."<br>
"Sir, if you don't turn around and give me your hands, I'm going to have to shoot you."<br>
"All right. Go ahead and shoot me."<br>
"Sir, if you don't turn around and give me your hands, I'm going to have to shoot you."<br>
"I said go ahead and shoot me!"<br>
"Sir, if you don't turn around and give me your hands, I'm going to have to shoot you."<br>
"What the hell is your problem? I'm giving you a direct order!"<br>
"Sir, if you don't turn around and give me your hands, I'm going to have to shoot you."<br>
"You're going to have to shoot me? I'll tell you what, if you don't turn around and give me your hands, I'm going to have to shoot you."<br>
"Sir, if you don't turn around and give me your hands, I'm going to have to shoot you."<br>
"Shit, you're not going to give up, are you?"<br>
Mr. Babintello pressed the button on the remote again.<br>
"Ouch! Fuck! Son of a bitch!" The agent fell to the ground, clutching his right foot.<br>
"Good boy," Mr. Babintello said. "That's the correct response when someone asks you politely."<br>
Mr. Babintello tossed the remote to Shark, who proceeded to swallow it whole.<br>
"Now, let's get out of here," Mr. Babintello said. "We've got an autor to find."<br>
"Unh." The agent tried to get up, but the pain was too much for him. He lay back down, and Mr. Babintello and Shark walked away, not looking back.<br>
Mr. Babintello and Shark flew to New York City, where they proceeded to get on the subway. They traveled to Manhattan, and got off at the Time Square station. Mr. Babintello and Shark walked out of the station and into the busy streets of Manhattan. The streets were filled with tourists and natives, and Mr. Babintello and Shark had to fight off a group of teenagers to get to their destination. Mr. Babintello, Shark, and the teenagers made it to the Time Square Building, where Mr. Babintello pointed to the top of the building.<br>
"Take us to the top, Shark."<br>
Shark leaped into the air, and took them to the top of the building. The top was a restaurant and bar, and Mr. Babintello and Shark walked inside. Mr. Babintello walked up to the bartender.<br>
"Excuse me, sir. Could you tell me where I could find the owner of this establishment?"<br>
"I'm sorry, but I can't tell you that."<br>
"Why not?"<br>
"Because you're not a customer of this establishment."<br>
"I'm not?"<br>
"No."<br>
"What if I was to buy a drink and stay here for a while?"<br>
"Then I could tell you where the owner is."<br>
"Gee, you're a real bitch, aren't you?"<br>
"Excuse me?"<br>
Mr. Babintello reached into his pocket, and pulled out a small remote control, which he pointed at the bartender.<br>
"Pew pew!" Suddenly, a small explosion went off, and the bartender was sent flying back to the ground, unconscious.<br>
"Thank you for your cooperation, sir."<br>
Mr. Babintello walked up to the elevator, and opened the door. He walked inside, and the door closed behind him. He pressed the button for the top floor, and the elevator started moving up. After a few seconds, the elevator reached the top floor, and the door opened. Mr. Babintello walked out of the elevator, and into an office.<br>
Mr. Babintello walked up to a desk, and saw a man sitting behind it, typing on a computer.<br>
"Excuse me, sir," Mr. Babintello said. "Could you tell me where the owner of this establishment is?"<br>
"What a coincidence," the man said, "I'm the owner. My name is Alexander Thompson. How can I help you?"<br>
"Well, Mr. Thompson. I'm here because I have some questions for you."<br>
"Questions? What kind of questions?"<br>
"Questions about your fanfic, Skin Deep: Narrative Misdirection in the Cave."<br>
"What? How do you know about that? It's supposed to be kept secret! It's not even up on the internet yet!"<br>
"It goddamn is. How else would've I been able to live... uh, read it? But that's not important. What's important is your identity."<br>
"What do you mean my identity?"<br>
"I'm talking about you, of course. Who the hell are you?"<br>
"I don't really see how that's any of your business."<br>
"You're goddamn right it's my business. Now who the hell are you?"<br>
Alexander Thompson turned away from Mr. Babintello, and pressed a button on his computer.<br>
"Well, I'll be damned," Mr. Babintello said. "It's you."<br>
"Yes, it's me," Alexander Thompson said. "I am, in fact, Mr. Babintello."<br>
"No fucking wa<br>

Mr. Babintello's Backstory<br>
<br>
Hello, children. I am Source, the HTML page you're currently looking at. Neat, huh? I'm Mr. Babintello's companion for this story. He doesn't usually like when stuff is this meta right at the get-go, but he'll manage. He's the most meta after all. So today's story, I, am about a fragment of his past. You know he can freely jump from story to story as he wishes? Although, he doesn't usually do this until the story is over. He likes to live it out, I guess. Now, I'm gonna tell about a time when it happened otherwise.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It was a hot summer day. Mr. Babintello was sitting in the middle of the sun, looking up at the sky. It was so bright and hot, though. It was a long day. He had a headache, a headache he couldn't get rid of. He was thinking about what to do next. And the only thing he could think of was to eat. He noticed a book on his table, a book titled Legendary Recipes from Taiwan. Of course, he did what he can do best. He blinked, and let himself get immersed into the new set of sights and smells around him. He was in the book, in a kitchen, with all the ingredients before him. A recipe book of course doesn't contain stories, but the environment still forms, and action still manifests. That's just how his ability works. Whatever narrative he enters, it adapts for the new character he becomes, even if it means turning into an actual narrative if it wasn't that before. He was standing in front of the kitchen table, the ingredients laid out neatly. The action came from the instructions of the recipe. He knew all of them exactly, and immediately began to carry them out. He was chopping, slicing, frying, boiling...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
He was having fun. He was enjoying the process of cooking almost as much as he enjoyed the product. He was enjoying himself so much that he didn't notice the pain vanish. He was having an awesome time. The realization that he was feeling better hit him as he noticed his headache had disappeared without him noticing. He was so used to being in pain, that he didn't even notice it was gone. But now... he noticed. He looked up. He was still in the kitchen, but the sun was beginning to set. It was evening, and the pain was gone. The pain was gone, and he had no idea what happened. He had no idea how he got better. Why? Why did he get better? Was it... his cooking?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
He decided to test this. He decided to go into other stories and see if it helped. And, if it did, then he would find a way to get back to the same story, and find a way to get more of whatever it was. He decided to start with a story of his own. A story he created about a young boy going through a summer camp. This story had a cabin in it, and a campfire. The boy's name was Michael. He was stuck in the cabin for the night, because the other kids went out to play, but he was too scared to go out. He was too scared to go out, so he started to read a book. Mr. Babintello decided to jump into this story, and decided to take control of the character. He began to read the book, but he began to have trouble. He couldn't focus on the book. He was distracted by the other campers. He saw them laughing and having fun. He saw them play in the woods. He saw them have fun. He was jealous. He wanted to join them, but he was too scared to go out. He decided to do what he's always done. He jumped into the book he was reading.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hey, Source. Yeah? Do you really have to be a story about me jumping from story to story? It's getting boring how the context always changes with no persistence whatsoever. What, you don't like it? What's there about this to like? Cut it out, show me something usable. Okay, okay. Let's get out of this meta stuff.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As I was saying, he jumped into the book he was reading (I swear this is the last jump inwards. I really hope so. One more and I'm out.). He had no idea what he was doing, but he knew he was doing something. He found himself in a kitchen. He had no idea what was going on. He had no idea why he was there. He had no idea what was happening. He had no idea what he was doing. He wasn't feeling the story. He had always felt the story. What was different this time? He tried to get up. He tried to get out of the story. He tried to find a way out. But he couldn't. He was trapped. He was trapped in a story he couldn't get out of. He was trapped in a story he didn't want to be in. Was it because the story he wrote wasn't focusing on the story inside the book, so when he jumped in, it was only filled with a limbo? He didn't know. He didn't know. He was panicking. He didn't know what to do. He got up and ran to the door. He tried to open the door, but it was locked. He couldn't get out. He couldn't get out. He began to think. He's in a kitchen. There's a table in front of him, with a bunch of ingredients he couldn't recognize. Was the boy reading a recipe book? He looked out the window. He saw a familiar landscape.<br>
<br>
"Am I in Taiwan? Is this the same recipe book?"<br>
<br>
His headache returned. This time, it was even more painful. The pain returned, and he was struck in the head. He fell to the floor.<br>
<br>
"I can't... I can't do this. I can't do this!"<br>
<br>
He began to cry. He didn't want to feel pain. He didn't want to be in a story that was doing this to him.<br>
<br>
"I can't... I can't... I can't..."<br>
<br>
He was in the middle of the kitchen. He was surrounded by ingredients. He was surrounded by food. He was surrounded by the story he was in.<br>
<br>
"I can't..."<br>
<br>
Amidst the migraine, though, he recognized something else. The smell. It was... fried rice? He looked at the ingredients. He saw rice. He saw eggs. He saw the ingredients he read about in the book.<br>
<br>
"This is... this is fried rice. This is the recipe I read about in that other book. And this is the book I'm reading right now. What if I just..."<br>
<br>
He started to make the recipe. He followed the instructions. He tried to be as accurate as possible. He tried to replicate the story he was in. He tried to find the right ingredients. He tried to find the right tools. He tried to find the right actions. And, with some help from the book, he succeeded. He made it. The best fried rice he made, a second time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
He was sitting in the kitchen, happily eating the fried rice he just made. His pain was gone, again. And not just his pain, the recipe, the story, too. He was back at the cabin. He didn't even manage to finish his meal, but the story was gone. How could it be gone? The story should only be gone when he jumps out. This is the first time this had ever happened, and since that day, probably the last. The reason the limbo and the sudden exit happened is still unknown to him. He doesn't want to experience it again, but some part of him does. He wants to know how it happened, what made that story special. And he wants to see if he can do it again.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So, what happened? Well, the obvious answer is, the limbo story was only a dream. Dreams are also stories, but it seems like not even Mr. Babintello can control stories while he's sleeping, and so, he wasn't able to jump out. The whole thing ended when the boy woke up next to the book he dropped on the floor. Since then, he probably reproduced this a bunch of times, but simply can't remember. His brain makes him jump out of a dream when he wakes up, whether he wants to or not. But this applies to everyone, even you, dear readers(Not to me of course, I'm just a webpage, containing an ai generated story but whatevs.). This means that this phenomenon isn't really a limitation of his ability, just a human imperfection. Although, he could be dreaming this story too, in which case, he should always fear that he could jump out at the best part only because he had woken up. Yeah, yeah, says the website acting all ominous. Why, it could be true... But it probably isn't, as I've already finished Inception, and not getting into bullshit like that in a while. Hmm, whatever you say, boss. Should we wrap this up? Yup, let me get back into being the website maker and submit this already. It's called a web developer, doofus. Who cares, you're just gonna be a lifeless white sheet when I jump out anyway. Oh, before you go, how do you rate me? You mean, the story? Yyyyup, it's the same thing, doofus. A strong 6. Now, bye. Good night, Mr. Babintello, it was nice having you!<br>
<br>
Editor's note (still Mr. Babintello): I lied, by the way. It's a 4 if I squint hard enough. Nothing more.
